Motion Detector Program w/Bokeh Time Series graph

This project is essentially a Webcam/Motion capture program designed to measure the times that anything enters the camera's field of view, and plots the times on an interactive Bokeh Time Series plot.

Once the code is ran, your webcam should activate within a few seconds. It'll open up in 3 tabs; colored, greyscale and blur. To end the program, simply click the "q" button on your keyboard.
